# Autonomous-Sailboat

Years ago, while teaching sailing on Lake Washington, I dreamed of a sailboat that could gracefully react to shifting winds and navigate between points without a crew. For my capstone mechatronics design course at Berkeley I got the chance to lead a team of my peers in realizing this dream.

Skills I took away from this project:

* System architecture design based on power and mechanical load requirements.
* Selecting servos, bearings, and materials according to load specifications.
* Designing and 3D Printing parts for a custom sensor.
* Integrating multiple sensors into a subsystem used for control of an airfoil.
* Writing firmware for communication between I2C and SPI devices and microprocessors.
